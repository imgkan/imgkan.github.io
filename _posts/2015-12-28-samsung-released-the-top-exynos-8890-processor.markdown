This month, the processor is a bustling market, Huawei releases Kirin 950 processor, followed by high-throughput buxiaolong 820, now, Samsung\'s turn to publish Exynos 8890 processor. Several processors are top processors will be applied on the flagship phone in 2016.[![Alt Moschino online shop](http://www.nodcase.com/images/large/i6/moschino_i61856_lrg.jpg)](http://www.nodcase.com/moschino-spray-paint-iphone-6-case-p-5184.html)　　This morning Samsung through website Exynos 8 Octa 8890 (referred to as Exynos 8890) processor, the processor is Samsung\'s second 14nm FinFET technology process to build the processor.　　And previous-generation Exynos 7420, Exynos 8890 is an integrated, single-chip, is Samsung\'s first 64-bit based ARMv8 architecture and the latest LTE Rel.12 Cat.12/13 standard design of CPU. The Samsung Exynos series processor performance has elevated to a new level.　　Specifically, Exynos 8890 processor using 14nmLPP of Samsung\'s own process, and uses four Mongoose (Mongoose) architecture design of independent core available for four core Cortex A53, to some extent belonging to the semi-autonomous architecture. In addition, the processor GPU powered Mali-T880, integrated Cat.12/Cat.13 baseband. Overall, over Exynos 8890 compared to Exynos performance 30%, power 10%.　　Samsung Electronics system integration chips Kyushik Hong, Vice-President of marketing said: \"Exynos 8890 is a new generation of mobile devices to create cutting-edge processor, integrated CPU of Samsung\'s advanced mobile technology, ISP, systems, and process technology. Through our independent design of the CPU cores and the industry\'s most advanced LTE standard, consumers will be able to move through the Exynos 8890 boasts a brand new computing experience. ”![Alt Samsung released the top Exynos 8890 processor](https://c2.staticflickr.com/2/1443/23906111032_e61b498929_z.jpg)　　Newer processors have more heterogeneous multiprocessing features, make effective use of 8 cores, 4 independent core and 4 core ARM Cortex-A53, making its performance and power consumption in products that stand out at the same level.　　Exynos 8,890 integrates the most advanced LTE Rel.12 Cat.12/13 system, the fastest download speeds up to 600Mbps (Cat.12), and faster uplink speeds of up to 150Mbps (Cat.13). With such high transmission speeds, Exynos 8890 will provide unprecedented mobile experience, give the user a short time sharing to transfer files, video and other content.　　Samsung\'s official website said that Samsung plans volume production later in the 2015 Exynos 8890 processor.

Now, however, Xiao long 820 already solve the heating problem and to enhance performance and battery life. So, next year, once again, Samsung and Qualcomm in-hand cooperation.　　Snapdragon 820 is Qualcomm first custom design of 64 bit four nuclear CPU, and custom has latest oriented heterogeneous calculation and design of height optimization custom Kyro CPU kernel, purpose is to solution more high performance and more long battery range time usually is phase conflict of history problem, so now all integration of core function, including CPU and GPU and digital signal processing device (DSP), other component, for different of task can more effective of combined up, To maximize efficiency and effectiveness.[Article correction]Collection is the collection of 1542 [Moschino iPhone 6 cover](https://www.1stdibs.com/fashion/accessories/handbags-purses/rare-vintage-moschino-handbag/id-v_282772/)Tags: mobile phone Science and technologyIf you need to reprint, you want the E-Mail authorization. annotated \"source Yu Weifeng network\", an unauthorized reprint, lost chapter reprinted, and this website will be held accountable by law!
